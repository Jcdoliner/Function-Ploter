# Function-Plotter
This is the program for a GUI Function Plotter Using Python. This program provides a simple alternative to create MatLab-like graphs by just providing the input function its bounds.
# Notes
- This Graphical interface runs only using IDEs that support Numpy. As of It is tested to work running the file on Spyder IDE.
- The input function needs to be entered using standard Numpy and Python operators. For example, if you want to plot x^2 you will have to write x**2 as it is the standard way to write powers in python. The following sample shows the correct way to enter input functions:

- Any feedback on how to improve the code is appreciated
